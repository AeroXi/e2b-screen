Shared Dependencies:

1. **Electron**: Electron is the main dependency that is shared across all the files. It is used to create the desktop application.

2. **registerShortcut function**: This function is used to register the F6 shortcut. It is used in the main.js file and possibly in the shortcut.js file.

3. **dragArea function**: This function is used to allow the user to drag an area for the screenshot. It is used in the renderer.js file and possibly in the dragArea.js file.

4. **saveScreenshot function**: This function is used to save the screenshot to a user-selected location. It is used in the renderer.js file and possibly in the saveScreenshot.js file.

5. **DOM Elements**: The DOM elements that are used by the JavaScript functions are likely defined in the index.html file and styled in the style.css file. The specific id names of these elements are not provided in the prompt.

6. **Shortcut Key (F6)**: The F6 key is used as a shortcut to initiate the screenshot process. This is likely used in the shortcut.js file and possibly in the main.js file.

7. **File System (fs) module**: This Node.js built-in module is likely used in the saveScreenshot.js file to write the screenshot file to the disk.

8. **ipcMain and ipcRenderer modules**: These Electron modules are used for inter-process communication between the main process (main.js) and the renderer process (renderer.js). They are likely used in the main.js, renderer.js, and possibly in the shortcut.js, dragArea.js, and saveScreenshot.js files.

9. **dialog module**: This Electron module is used to display native system dialogs for opening and saving files, alerting, etc. It is likely used in the saveScreenshot.js file to prompt the user to select the save location.

10. **screen module**: This Electron module is used to get screen size and display information. It is likely used in the dragArea.js file to limit the draggable area to the screen size.

11. **clipboard module**: This Electron module is used to implement a clipboard for copying and pasting. It might be used in the saveScreenshot.js file to copy the screenshot to the clipboard.

12. **Shortcut registration and unregistration messages**: These are IPC messages used to communicate between the main process and the renderer process for registering and unregistering the F6 shortcut. They are likely used in the main.js, renderer.js, and shortcut.js files.
